## Objectives

1. Assess the significance of sustainable livelihood capital in the adaptation process, especially in Crop, Farm, Irrigation, and Economic Management.
2. Understand the mediation role of investments and farming purposes.
3. Identify how climatic and non-climatic factors moderate adaptation.
4. Analyze stakeholders' actions, priorities, and goals in adapting to climate change using the VIABLE framework.

## Methodology

- **Data Collection**: A structured questionnaire was utilized, and data were collected from 800 farmers from December 2021 to February 2022. The regions focused on were the irrigated agricultural areas in the Indus Plain of the Punjab and Sindh provinces, Pakistan.
  
- **Analysis**: We employed the Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling approach to the VIABLE framework (VIABLE-SEM) for the analysis.

## Key Findings

- Livelihood capital was identified as the prime determinant for farmers’ adaptation strategies.
  
- Out of several variables, the primary purpose of farming, available investment options, and natural and human constraints were found to be less pivotal.
  
- The study mapped 13 notable viability pathways representing investment priorities, farming purposes, and challenges in climate change adaptation.
  
- Non-climatic factors were seen to have a negative effect, while climatic factors had a positive role with the relationship between capital and adaptation.

## Implications

The insights from this study are crucial for policymakers and researchers aiming to craft effective climate change adaptation strategies for Pakistan's agriculture sector.
